These are two UMATs, one standard version and one hybrid version for HYBRID elements for finite strain viscoelasticity with damage. 
This is a general version of Reese and Govindjee (1998) model for any type of I_1 and I_2 invariants strain energy for the deviatoric part.
The hydrostatic part U(J) is also viscoelastic.
The constitutive equations as the damage parameters are detailed in [2.	F. Gouhier, J. Diani, A. vandenbroucke, 2024. A finite strain viscoelastic model with damage and tension-compression asymmetry considerations for solid propellants. Mechanics of Materials, 199, 105152, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2024.105152.]
The HowtoUse_UMAT.pdf file shows several validation cases and explains how to modify the UMAT according to the strain energy of interest.

Several input files are provided for testing on a 1 element cube or on a pokerchip structure.
